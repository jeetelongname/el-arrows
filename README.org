#+TITLE: Arrows

A set of Threading macro's blatantly rewritten from [[https://github.com/nightfly19/cl-arrows][cl-arrows]]

* Roadmap
- [-] Formalise direction
- [ ] find more arrow idea's (this is now a small obsession)
- [ ] Implement [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-197/srfi-197.html][srfi 197]]
- [ ] Implement arrows from the [[https://lexi-lambda.github.io/threading/][racket threading library]]
- [ ] Implement arrows from the [[https://github.com/rplevy/swiss-arrows][swiss arrows library]]
- [ ] add an [[https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13/IO.html#inspect/2][inspect function similar to elixirs for easier debugging]]


* Reference
| Macro name | Description                                 | Nickname      |
|------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------|
| =arr->=    | argument first. Identical to =thread-first= | tip           |
| =arr->>=   | argument last. Identical to =thread-last=   | spear         |
| =arr-<>=   | argument first with placeholders            | diamond wand  |
| =arr-<>>=  | argument last with placeholders             | diamond spear |

each of them has a =fn= variant which allows for "curried" like function syntax
they take the name of =arr-fn-NAME= so for example =arr-fn-<>>=

* Examples
** Simple threading
here we are just pushing a number through a contrived pipeline
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(arr-> 8 (1+) (number-to-string) (string-pad 5) (string-pad 9 nil t))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "     9      "

Here we are using =->>= to pass this list in as the last argument of these maps
and filters.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(arr->> '(1 2 3 4 5)
        (seq-map #'1+)
        (seq-filter #'cl-evenp))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 2 | 4 | 6 |

** placeholder example
If we go back to that last example we see a limitation, we can only thread
/last/, we could not use =seq-reduce= here as it requires the sequence to be the
2nd argument out of 3 (placing it in the middle). This is where diamond variants
come into play.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(arr-<>> '(1 2 3 4 5)
         (seq-map #'1+)
         (seq-filter #'cl-evenp)
         (seq-reduce #'+ <> 0))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 12

Here =<>= is a placeholder meaning our value is passed into that spot, this
makes it very easy to compose functions that might not have uniform positioning
of the passed argument (like with seq).

** fn example
We also provide composition functions which are useful when you want to have a
function that represents a set of transformations. this also allows your code to
look [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming][point free]].
All arrow macro's have a =fn= variant
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'arr)

(seq-map (arr-fn-> (1+) (number-to-string)) '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 2 | 3 | 4 |

*** Lambda short hands
as a side effect this allows for lambda short hands without the need to use the
entire lambda syntactic form. This is not as nice nor as flexible as something
like [[https://github.com/cadadr/elisp#dollarel][dollar.el]] but still is worth mentioning IMHO
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(seq-map (arr-fn-<> (* <> <>)) '(2 3 4))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 4 | 9 | 16 |
